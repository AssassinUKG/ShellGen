# ShellGen
A reverse shell generator written in bash

I got bored lmao
This is shite don't use it 

Todo if I can be bothered:

- add msfvenom options
- maybe make an interactive menu
- add options to launch the netcat/rlwrap listener at the same time of running the script
- output shells to a file
- fix powershell for some reason it doesnt like it
